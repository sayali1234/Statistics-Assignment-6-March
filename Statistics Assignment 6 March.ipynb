    "    1)Mean: The mean is the most common measure of central tendency, and it represents the average value of the dataset. It is\n",

    "    outliers and can be influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "    2)Median: The median is the middle value in the dataset when the values are ordered from smallest to largest. It is a \n",

    "    the distribution.\n",
    "    3)Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. It is useful for identifying the most common\n",
    "    value or category in the dataset, and it can be used for both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "    Measures of variability include:\n",
    "    1)Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset. It provides information about\n",
    "    the spread of the data, but it is sensitive to outliers and can be influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "    2)Standard deviation: The standard deviation measures the average distance of each value from the mean. It is a common \n",
    "    measure of variability that is useful for understanding the spread of the data, and it is less sensitive to outliers than\n",
    "    the range.\n",
    "    3)Interquartile range: The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third and first quartiles of the\n",
